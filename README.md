This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect and classify human emotions from facial images. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. The system is trained on publicly available datasets like FER-2013 and CK+ and is designed for applications in healthcare, customer service, and security.

Features
Emotion Detection: Classifies facial expressions into seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

High Accuracy: Achieves 85% accuracy on the FER-2013 test set.

Scalable Architecture: Built using TensorFlow and Keras for easy integration into real-time systems.

Data Augmentation: Includes preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance
